C:
Okay today's date is the 14th of
December 2018 and we are here at Qlik
offices and this is Christoffer MacFie
talking. And I'm here with...

J:
Jonas Hörström.

C
Eh... And we're gonna talk a
little bit about mainly three topics: APIs
in general and release notes and online
communities around software platforms.
Ehm... So, in general
how important would you say that API
documentation is?

J
If I start working with
something I think it's really important
actually because I've started with
different products and... when; and you
thought about the products; quality of
the projects; the fun item in it... it's
hard connection to the API documentation.
I have a home assistant fresh in mind [laughter] which I'm
using right now which I don't like at
all after a couple of hours in it. It's
really hard to find some stuff.

C
Because the documentation is...

J
Yeah I
think it was scattered and it was... I
couldn't find everything I wanted so it;
it seems to be around in blogs and posts
everywhere.

C
Mm

J
But they are one date in time,
and since it's not a stable product it's
0.8 something something. Ehh... they might not
work, and the; then I want to go to the main
page and I could find stuff there... but I
think they were were lacking examples or
lacking the full picture to really get
what I wanted.

C
Mm

J
So that's a problem I think.

C
So
when you look at API documentation...
What are you generally looking for, what
do you want from a documentation?

J
I'm lazy so first of all examples. [laughter].
Just like a lot of people. And then... So
first examples, then it's the more
broader picture. Does it look like
something I would understand or is it.. is it
scattered a lot of different areas and so on.

C
Mm.

J
And I think the reason for that...
You're looking at so many different
small products in the word so before you
want to invest a lot of time in it you
try to or you... Maybe you do it without
knowing, but you assess the quality based
on what you see the first five minutes
or something.

C
Mm.

J
So you; you start looking
into it and yes you shouldn't play down by
look and feel on that because that; if
it's fresh in you and updated, yes it's
good and it's positive, if it looks like
they are asking others to continue; I
think that's a positive thing as well...

C
Mm.

J
But I think it goes down to examples and
then, does it feel full is it; is there
enough things? Can I see in the beginning
that all it looks like it's covers the
ideas I had about this. So it's not if I
click on something it's like yeah

there's you have to look into this

ripple to find this to find this or even

worse it's in French it's it's pending

near translation can you do the use

Google Translate anyone know you

mentioned API samples they were very

important to you they are because since

I'm lazy I want to get something started

fast and then I want to invest and I

think that's the the reason is for me to

get caught up in something if I if I

want to invest I can invest as much time

as I can depending part but but to know

if I should do it I tend to look at

examples and ideas how to accomplish

something because I want to know do I

need to write like 20 lines of code to

do it or is it free and if it's free is

it's actually doing what I want to

really do I need to do a lot of weird

stuff with the three lines to make it

work hmm so do you

as it having working out quickly is

important to you do you use the that's

the is that the main thing I use the

examples for to just copy paste to have

something going or I think it's to get

started mmm because

I like the idea of having something in

build up on that and I very rarely think

about okay let's use this bakery and

then I read through the whole API and

then I start working no I go to the

first example I can find attacked me in

the example we copy paste it and then I

don't get there I run it cool it looks

like this and then okay what does this

method you and then I go and look at

that mess okay that's not and then I do

something more and then I realized that

maybe I should know a little bit for me

because I'm just patching here and then

I thought it tend to read a little bit

more about it maybe how we should do it

that's all okay I like to play around

before I and I guess I'm not I'm not

like a senior developer working on our

feature I go to release soccer so it's

also because I'm it's hobby products I'm

looking mmm

so when are you willing to accept not

having working code quickly if if I have

an assignment I really won't need know

what to do and I have some time I know

good for this and maybe it's it's a more

complex task and I know that I need to

Seoul

so I have already thought in my mind

that I need to invest more than like

here's two hours for this to get started

maybe I understand this is I'm going to

do a new scheduling system for releasing

that and I know I know enough they

require some writing in our state

machine or something that I know okay I

already know that I need to that's quite

a long time and I had heard that this is

a good API or this is a good product

then I would start to work um you know

so one of the things we're trying to

understand is what exactly is good

documentation so if we use the examples

is there something there that you

thought of okay this is something I'll

always expect from me good documentation

is there something missing something

made that made you react I think that

was a class or something where it there

was not an explanation

if it was sake that was one which only

had information in about see here I

think it was Baker API where they it

doesn't say what's here

or if it was to suit this super and you

know I read I could get more from the

release notes than I could from the real

documentation no I don't like that

because they it's good with a release

but it's one item in time so I want the

real documentation to actually mirror

that and I think it was when you created

an Indian the super end euro sound like

nothing there was no information about

that in the real I think it was only

Creighton yeah I don't think there's any

things that actually is that it came

into the super end in here but then you

called my intention attention apparently

because I was looking more for more

information yeah just example well that

was fun thing yeah I think it was

getting a when you created a new Baker

what you you're supplying the engine but

there's no explanation or the

constructor of the maker I was missing

that but if we talk more in general

about how we can should construct a

documentation is there anything is there

aught of any red flags when you see you

encounter a new software platform and

read the documentation are there any red

flags that you think ok this is if you

have a lot of proprietary parameters or

something which or list just listed

without any description on it I think

that's bad I also don't like if there is

no examples as I said before I really

like to have some example in the

beginning of a class showing or whatever

it is library something just showing

this is a simple example and then

you can use that to navigate down so a

simple one maybe I'm not the worst one

as well but have something like that in

the beginning is really important for me

how much of a should they be example be

more of a snippet or should it be put in

a context more how much of a context is

needed

I think it's depends on what type of

area it is if it's uh if it's a utility

library I mean that's a snippet is good

enough and if it's an item doing sorry

if it's let's say yeah we have those

products which are that's a reading

statistics from github for just look at

today and there they had an example this

is how we should do it and okay that's a

good example I have two factor

authentication what do i do nothing but

it's good enough I can understand how

big the library looks like Mason example

what I can do then I search further from

my special case which is outside example

so that was good for adapter one if if

there would be a full solution where I

had to install something to get it going

then I would assume that there was an

example somewhere because if if the

first thing is to I think that is the

speed to run something neuro determinant

so in our case in clique or would be

that if there wouldn't be any easy way

to set up the engine and quickly pull it

down I wouldn't bother because it's too

long time for me to okay now I have to

download something a feeling a for I

don't know a lot of stuff before I can

even get it running the small snippet I

have here

that's dangerous I think then you're

into this that prove I have to assign a

lot of time on it make sure that I make

it methodically and set up my ID that's

okay so the the size of the example

depends on the context of the yes so I

would say in most cases it's how fast I

can get something after running I will

have a lot better feeling about the

stuff if there's

has made very fast guide on just getting

something else then I can evaluate if I

would like to take this or one of the

three other items I found for this area

and we need to do if it's like a helper

library somebody'd see crucial I was

there because it if it would be an

external course or a song if I had reach

my show she is probably one which is

most popular and then there is free

which are popular them it needs to be

very quick easy way to get it running

for me to understand okay I should use

this one hmm I didn't mention him before

we start the interview what is your role

here at click I'm a development manager

for the click core team I'm not

developer for saying here wannabe hobby

and my education so what is your tasks

during the day I say so I I would say in

this this form here it's other people

manager and I'm and I think the roles or

scrum master or tried one part of a

tried which means that I'm part of the

planning the work but also about

suggesting solutions or priorities in

the team a little bit of product I ought

to get a bit of architect and a product

designer so it's a mix of those things

and development is I would say it's a

minimal part I use it because I like to

understand what we're doing in the team

and of interest I think in my role you

could get out a gift away without

knowing anything but you had to work in

a different way

mmm-hmm so in as part of your role you

don't have to read a lot of

documentation it's more when you're

working on side projects yes so it's if

I'm doing something in the code here

I'm trying to do sometimes I do it of

course but it's not my main no it's not

my part of the work hmm so but you're

like if click were to use a new software

platform you're still part of the

decision-making to use that platform or

are you taking listening to for example

architects and what they want to use and

you approve that or what's your rosin

yeah I'm part of it no I will rely if an

architect know that I want this because

of that I would because I would never

say anything against them if it's if I

don't have any person and so no that's

true I would probably suggest and based

on my experience suggests what I believe

is my idea of a good platform do you

think it is working card quickly just a

consequence of good documentation and

API examples or is it a separate aspect

no I think it's the same actually yeah I

think it's there every library needs to

sell itself and proved its use and I

think one way is to do it like that you

could have a the most simple one and

that will be a lot harder to sell to

people if it's not easily

[Music]

because we if we it would be interesting

to get a in this interviews I'm talking

directly to you architects and

developers and such but now we have a

manager role here which isn't as you say

directly involved in the documentation

reading in its work role so would you

say that you how much of an interest in

your work role do you take in API

documentation of a software platform

that would be used in the product for

example the platform for how we write

documentation or we could take we could

take both examples like if click were to

use another software platform in in its

product and it had to be approved and

all that how much of an interest you

take in your working role for that I

think I think it's hard to say how much

but I take interest in it

mmm because I that's a simple one like a

UI framework or something like that I

want to know why we're choosing a

special framework and I think it's it's

twofold one is of course the one which

are important my role will this be

something which is valuable not just

today but in two years is it something

which works well with competence we have

the team and in the surroundings which

is something weird because it's found we

have to have a really good really simple

so so those are and then of course how

live that one is if he ever is starting

to maybe not in the my current role but

in my previous role where we bought the

software platforms then it was very

important that they are maintained

correctly and they are cost efficient

and that we get the support we need hmm

so all those questions are very

important to me now and then I would say

the rest is just my technical interest

feel it's not obliged but it's fun to

know about those though so that's the

other part but not so specific so it's

those things you mentioned is that

something that if there's some things

that only managers care about that

developers or architects wouldn't care

about when using a when it comes to

documentation I think that vapors tend

to play down the need for production it

could be that it's not that it's missed

out but at least in some places it's it

looks good if they it's fun to work with

it's good and I totally understand that

but sometimes it could be that you also

have have it a factory environment and

if something breaks down in that Factory

you will lose a lot of money each

minutes or so then you have to look into

a lot of other stuff like is there any

support contracts here which make sure

that this contact or there is a

percentage of times they're going to

happen because that's going to be a

discussion I have if I buy that sort of

support contract I would think

developers don't really want to talk

about those things there it's not there

a deal it's more or less purchase

purchasing discussion and like support

discussion and that me as a developer I

think you know I'm more responsible for

those so in my current role we don't

have that many of those because we're

using mostly open source code work in

open source world where there are other

things that play which is more important

like how well is this adopted by the

majority of local sort word and how much

maintenance is it and so on and I was a

historically it's not there the

developer the manager's primary

knowledge so here I depend a little

moron architects women taking those

decisions and maybe that's also why I

want to dig more into this because I

need to understand so I can be support

when when we're taking such decisions

mm-hmm

if we move over to release notes how

often would you say that you look at

release we're doing automatic upgrades

okay okay you have to see how it's done

so as I went into the other it's a

failed test okay I need to understand

why and then there was a link to the

release notes where I can see why and

that's all oh this is nothing

so that's that's thing otherwise it I

always say it's for my if I'm doing a

hobby product I might do it if it's I

know it's zero point version because

that might break break my way existing

corporation mmm but it's hobby so yeah

it's it's not that social well okay

because once again it's interesting to

see if release notes matter at all to

managers because we'll get the

perspective of architects and developers

from other interviews so do you think

general managers in general or you care

about release notes I would say from

from a manager perspective I care if it

breaks my stuff and if I need to add any

resources to this then that's my

perspective so nothing detailed like I

said that's not something that we look

into the furniture so if I'm going to if

we only talk about okay should we

upgrade to this solution I would post it

and I would participate in a meeting

where we took the decision then I would

be interested mmm because I want to know

how big of a change and how much time do

we need to invest in such a change so

that's very important

and so for major releases that I think

that's the most important for a manager

small patches I don't think they are

only important if something has mmm so

in the material we had a year two

extremes

one very short version and were quite

elaborate version because it's when it

comes to writing release notes it's a I

mean you have to a company has to spend

time and therefore money in order to

have more thorough release notes and

it's a balance to between these two how

much should you write do you have any

opinion on how much I think the short

one for imaginary I think that was

enough that there changes in this area

okay there we are

it looks like they they've added some

stuff and are we using the differ kg

stuff so so from a manic perspective I

think that's that's enough for me if a

little bit further I think when I read

the more detailed version I think that

it was good but I suspected that to be

in the real documentation is there so

for me it would be we have added these

stuff here's a link to the documentation

where it's I don't know mmm I think okay

so maybe more like okay you can't use

this form or use this new them all the

if not how you use an example states in

the region documentation mmm otherwise

you delicate so again from a manager

perspective when you decided to use a

new platform then it has to be approved

its release that's something that will

be looked at

before as part of the are we gonna use

this yeah I think that matiee the patch

ones I think being your changes like

that sometimes have other presentations

not in the release notes section it's

more like this new feature to have all

these many features and I'm sure would

probably look at that and see if it

matches their need and then probably

also architects and developers to tell

how much work they needed to put in to

fulfill the rest of the stuff the

deprecated stuff was known so I don't

think the manager it's even even before

like even before something has been

adopted you probably all probably check

ok that it's like the pricing you'll

infect II like lore surrounding it and

maybe it'll check out how is the

permutation how is it support but you

probably not check ok are the release

notes gonna be good when we're gonna

need them in one year probably not

I think that's unfortunately not to say

it's I probably should and then I have

to back a little bit on one thing since

I also have a scrum master role as a

manager which is not normal but in this

company we have it I would be interested

in what has actually changed when I came

into that solution so first I would take

the decision on a modular but if I get

into scrum master and then are more into

an operative mode and then I need to

know okay what what type has chance do

what deprecated Partizan then I would

probably read it together office it's a

little bit of a mixed role that's why

maybe it's mixed

mmm we can move over to a white

community night

so in general when I just say that a

software has an online community what

does that mean to you active discussions

that people are asking question and

they're getting answers quickly and

preferably not an active there are

people out there helping so in

communities that you like what did they

have in common that they are polite

first and they're there they are

elaborate answers to questions if

someone comes with a problem also on

there are people answering to the right

level because sometimes it could be

people who misuse this but I have to

show something to my manager please do

this for me I don't think those but you

should at least support out here some

help but to get you stormed here you

have this thing yeah so is it important

that the community feels alive that's a

very and also as you said they take

immunity must be helpful then it helpful

and but also polite yeah Politis that

I've seen some communities they are an

exception but they could be like yeah as

I said read the fucking that people are

trying and I think that's scaring people

away yeah supposed to be very complex

and cool but it's not helping if you're

inviting we

like that with that turn you away from

if you'll just stop me I was using a

software platform I need to Google

something and you realize okay this is

the kind of yeah it's a decision which

goes a lot of indicators even if it's

like that then you have bad communicator

documentation that needs to know that

really and because as community it could

be either be like for a click we have to

branch or comma community that's managed

by clique themselves and then you have

like a communities that only exist on

Stack Overflow for example for they is

Stack Overflow one where it has its own

life is it important that the the

company behind the software that they

are a part of that community not

necessarily if taking if it's so famous

that people are there and answering all

the questions and they are correct to

sponsors then I think the company has

succeeded in something really cool so

for me it would just tell me that yeah

this is a really good product people are

helping each other just because they

like it that's good this has also a

thing that's that's a time I first and

therefore money by the company that they

spend a lot of time I'm answering

community questions how important is it

that the company answers questions I

think it goes down to money question

area if it's if you can get I get by

without because there's a lot of people

are saying these things for you then

you're lucky you're a lucky company and

you don't need to do that

if it's not it's a niche product or if

it's you're struggling to get people to

work with and so on I think you have to

help people are get going if you're

going to create the community I think a

lot about what you you probably need to

have a seed the community strategy and

then you can back away if you think that

the communities is working by itself in

the beginning you probably need to be

there hmm so like just overall to put it

concise what what do you want from an

online community I think it's I want

answers to my questions I think that's

it so if I'm if further but if I'm

looking for different from evaluating

different products what I want for my

community is an active community I want

to see that's live there's good answers

to questions and it feels like then then

it's a plus in my decision mmm if I have

already decided or there's only one then

of course I have to make do with what I

have but then I have the same needs but

maybe I can have less more less because

I have to I have to use it so so let's

say that there was such a thing as a

flawless documentation would you still

need an online community not if I didn't

have any documentation gives all I need

mmm okay so yes that's also a any

company could invest energy in making

the community more alive or making API

documentation better so making the

documentation better it could replace a

community the need for a community you

say yeah

but the I think that is it's a little

bit dependent that area because it could

be really hard to provide examples which

are good enough for most people who

comes an interest area mm-hmm

while a community or more maybe if

they're willing they can put the

solution in perspective to the question

which a documentation couldn't do so if

you have an area which are very generic

for example you can do whatever with it

and then people come in are able to do

this fun stuff then I guess a community

could catch that person easier than our

documentation we should be very generic

in them okay don't really know if I can

do this or not

mmm the communique yeah of course you

can you just use these four or five

different calls and then something like

this and here's a very easy to see it so

in in reality they're do there is a need

of for an online community yeah if it's

a very generic product because you said

the perfect or perfect augmentation

would have a solution for requesting

you're kidding okay so so if but if you

step down to a more realistic approach

yes I think that our it exists there

exists companies and solutions which

would require community have any

questions for me or something you

thought I would ask that I didn't know I

think it was good at the Oscar what my

role was I think it's very important to

to steer it yeah but now getting that

perspective I think when I started

thinking here different actually so I

started answering for two different

perspective we just might be a little

bit confusing so maybe I should just

describe my previous row

I was a product owner and a little bit

of response over purchasing in my

current we're working purely know the

source more my role is more technical so

I have a large interest in solutions but

not purchasing decision since most

things are for free you know the source

and it's the technology which rules so

they are different somehow

these different roles mmm open-source

bird is actually complicating it a

little bit you don't have this

historically ok the manager stands for

the money and and the developers for

their so that might be something you can

pick up here yeah yes what I made it

clear your role as India we had a good

perspective from the nominal okay thanks
