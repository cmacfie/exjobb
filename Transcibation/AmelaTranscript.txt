C: Eh... Okay, so today's the sixth of September
A: December.
C: December! Sorry. Eh.. And we're at the Qlik offices. 
A: Mm...
C: And this is Christoffer MacFie talking. And I'm here with...
A: Amela Ajanovic.
C: And you work here at Qlik?
A: Yeah I work at Qlik as a software engineer.
C: Mm! Ehm... So... I have some questions for you regarding, ehm... We're gonna talk about API related stuff¨
A: Mm...
C: And we're gonna talk a little bit about release notes, and we're gonna talk a little bit about online communities around software platforms. And you looked at some material before hand.
A: Yeah.
C: So if we start with, eh, API related things
A: Okay.
C: Ehm... So... When you're looking at... Ehm... How important would you say that API examples and documentation is for a software platform?
A: Eh... Probably one of the most important things when it comes to documentation, because... I would say most; for most people that's the first thing you look at
C: Mm.
A: 'cause if it's an API you're not familiar with examples are the... ehm.. The way you actually want to get familiar with how things are working.
C: Mm.
A: So...
C: So when...
A: ...very important.
C: So when you look at API examples, what are you trying to, ehm... what are you looking for? Like... When you look up API examples, what it; what is it you wanna fínd out?
A: Eh... I don't know! I guess it depends on what I'm looking for, sometimes it can be; If I'm looking at a specific method, I want to be able to find that quickly.
C: Mm.
A: And to have an example of; of how that thing works in specific way. Ehm... And I guess it should be... clear examples, consistent examples, and ehm... Yeah I don't know.
C: Mm.
A: Eh...
C: Would you...
A: And also that there is some explanation, not just code.
C: Mm.
A: But also explanation about what that code does.
C: Mm.
A: Yeah some kind of  documentation about the methods and what they do and... Eh, how the should behave.
C: Mm.
A: Mm.
C: So is it; so would; so it's more of a, eh... So it's a mixture of, eh... Trying to understand how they are used, and where they are used? Or...
A: Yeah. Yeah, of course.
C: And... Copy/Pasting code, is that something that... is... good for a code examples as well, or, just to...
A: Eh, what do you mean? For; You mean for the developer to be able to just copy/paste and try something out?
C: Mm.
A: I think it's good if you can get like a; if you can try something out quickly. Just to see that that's what your... that it works, I guess. Ehm... But it doesn't need to be a complete example in which, you know, everything is done for you.
C: Mm. So it's more important of a concise example...
A: Mm.
C: With just what they're trying to explain rather than a big one?
A: Yeah I think it's good to have, eh; It really depends on the case. Sometimes it's nice to have both. 
C: Mm.
A: Like to use that example in the context of something bigger.
C: Mm.
A: But it really depends of the method, if it's something; something as simple as; you know you need to do a copy/paste, then it's enough to just focus on that simple method.
C: Mm.
A: How to do a copy/paste with this API.
C: Okay.
A: Ehm.. Because it doesn't really have a lot of dependencies on other things.
C: Mm.
A: Ehm... So I think it; it really depends. Ehm... When it comes to; it's not really APIs, but in Qlik, when it comes to ehm... this scripting language when you develop apps and things. For example, eh.. There it's nice to have examples that are within a bigger context.
C: Mm.
A: Ehm... So yeah, it kind of depeneds. But, eh... But I would say if I have to choose if; it would be more concise.
C: Mm.
A: Examples that just show you; Okay this is what I wanted to know.
C: Mm.
A: And I don't have to go searching like... a pile of examples.
C: So you said, in the context of Qlik, it's better to have a bigger example. When is it not... When it's; In what context is better to have a smaller example...
A: Mm.
C: Than, like... What makes Qlik, eh... Need bigger examples.
A: Yeah, yeah! So in this sense it wasn't Qlik as everything related to Qlik, it was specificially, because... Yeah. I always complain and I think other people always complain with the documentation regarding the... app development and scripting.
C: Mm.
A: And in that case you need more knowledge before you can jump into
C: Mm
A: A specific method. So there you kind of; it's important to have more step-by-step things.
C: Okay so.
A: Eh...
C: So because it's more advanced, we need, ehm...
A: Yeah! Yeah, because you can't just; you need some pre-requisite knowledge in order to get to that
C: Mm. Okay.
A: So I think in every documentation it's important if you know that you need some, eh... some pre-requsuite knowledge 
C: Mm.
A: That's not maybe very common, that it's nice to have those examples as well.
C: Okay.
A: Or at least, some links of references to where... can you learn about that.
C: Mm.
A: Because it's, eh... Yeah it can be quite annoying when you get; start reading an exaplanation and there's ten; ten things you don't even know what they mean
C: Mm.
A: And it's no where explained what they mean.
C: Okay.
A: So, yeah.
C: Ehm... So how does it affect you if you're, eh... Looking at API examples and they're... not very good. How does that affect your work?
A: Ehm... Well if I have a choice to find something else to use, then I would just do that. 
C: Mm.
A: Ehm... If I don't have a choice; well usually you have a choice, I mean... usually you can, eh... choose between different... different options of which APIs to go to, to do the same thing. Ehm... So in that case, if you select one thing and then you see the documentation is bad, usually you just scrape it and turn to something different.
