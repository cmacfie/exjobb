1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:08,730
okay today's date is the 14th of

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,370
December 2018 and we are here at click

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,620
offices and this is Christopher McAfee

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,160
talking and I'm here with you know

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,279
system and bring you're gonna talk a

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,820
little bit about mainly three topics API

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:31,019
sin general and release notes and online

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:32,630
communities around software platforms so

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,370
in general

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:39,239
how important would you say that API

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,820
documentation is if I start working with

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,579
something I think it's really important

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,420
actually because I've started with

14
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,879
different products and when and your

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,210
thought about the products quality of

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,340
the projects the funds item in it it's

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,289
hard connection today hate documentation

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,300
home assistant fresh in mind we said

19
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,119
using right now which I don't like at

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,729
all after a couple of hours in it it's

21
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,950
really hard to find some stuff you

22
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,680
forget the documentation it's not yeah I

23
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,049
think it was scattered and it was I

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,479
couldn't find everything I wanted so it

25
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,900
it seems to be around in blogs and posts

26
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,000
I were ok but they are one date in time

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,020
and since it's not a stable product it's

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,500
0.8 something something they might not

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,770
work and then I want to go to the main

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,659
page and I could find stuff there but I

31
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,520
think y'all were lacking examples or

32
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,390
liking the full picture to really get

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,619
what I wanted mmm that's a problem so

34
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,619
when you look at API documentation

35
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,509
what are you generally looking for what

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,280
do you want from me and documentation

37
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,229
and places the first of all examples

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:01,469
just like a lot of people and then so

39
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,570
first examples then it's the more

40
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,430
broader picture it does it look like

41
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,129
something I would understand or is it's

42
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,709
it's scattered a lot of different

43
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,080
terraces and I think the reason for that

44
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,140
is

45
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,840
here you're looking at so many different

46
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,240
small products in the word so before you

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,870
want to invest a lot of time in it you

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:25,090
try to or you maybe you do it without

49
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,920
knowing but you assess the quality based

50
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,980
on what you see the first five minutes

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,220
or something so you you start looking

52
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,740
into it and yes you shouldn't play down

53
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,530
look and feel on that because that if

54
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,110
it's fresh in you and updated yes it's

55
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,300
good and it's positive if it looks like

56
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,950
they are asking others to continue so I

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,430
think that's a positive thing as well

58
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:53,680
but I think it goes down to examples and

59
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:55,900
then does it feel full is it is there

60
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,850
enough things can I see in the beginning

61
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,790
that all it looks like it's covers the

62
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,930
ideas I had about this so it's not if I

63
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,520
click on something it's like yeah

64
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,910
there's you have to look into this

65
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:12,280
ripple to find this to find this or even

66
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:14,110
worse it's in French it's it's pending

67
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,330
near translation can you do the use

68
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:22,209
Google Translate anyone know you

69
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:25,300
mentioned API samples they were very

70
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:27,550
important to you they are because since

71
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,239
I'm lazy I want to get something started

72
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:33,400
fast and then I want to invest and I

73
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,180
think that's the the reason is for me to

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,700
get caught up in something if I if I

75
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:44,050
want to invest I can invest as much time

76
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:46,570
as I can depending part but but to know

77
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,180
if I should do it I tend to look at

78
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,040
examples and ideas how to accomplish

79
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,840
something because I want to know do I

80
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,269
need to write like 20 lines of code to

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,280
do it or is it free and if it's free is

82
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,720
it's actually doing what I want to

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,700
really do I need to do a lot of weird

84
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,600
stuff with the three lines to make it

85
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,940
work hmm so do you

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,230
as it having working out quickly is

87
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,940
important to you do you use the that's

88
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,920
the is that the main thing I use the

89
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,690
examples for to just copy paste to have

90
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,049
something going or I think it's to get

91
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,870
started mmm because

92
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:26,979
I like the idea of having something in

93
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,680
build up on that and I very rarely think

94
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:31,389
about okay let's use this bakery and

95
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,090
then I read through the whole API and

96
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:36,190
then I start working no I go to the

97
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,409
first example I can find attacked me in

98
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,930
the example we copy paste it and then I

99
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:43,539
don't get there I run it cool it looks

100
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,069
like this and then okay what does this

101
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:48,039
method you and then I go and look at

102
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:49,780
that mess okay that's not and then I do

103
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,699
something more and then I realized that

104
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,819
maybe I should know a little bit for me

105
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,470
because I'm just patching here and then

106
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,659
I thought it tend to read a little bit

107
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,210
more about it maybe how we should do it

108
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:05,259
that's all okay I like to play around

109
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:07,210
before I and I guess I'm not I'm not

110
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,639
like a senior developer working on our

111
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,620
feature I go to release soccer so it's

112
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,490
also because I'm it's hobby products I'm

113
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,979
looking mmm

114
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,669
so when are you willing to accept not

115
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:20,860
having working code quickly if if I have

116
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,099
an assignment I really won't need know

117
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:29,680
what to do and I have some time I know

118
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:32,650
good for this and maybe it's it's a more

119
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,280
complex task and I know that I need to

120
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,259
Seoul

121
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,060
so I have already thought in my mind

122
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:39,669
that I need to invest more than like

123
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,639
here's two hours for this to get started

124
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,800
maybe I understand this is I'm going to

125
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,330
do a new scheduling system for releasing

126
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,330
that and I know I know enough they

127
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,219
require some writing in our state

128
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,039
machine or something that I know okay I

129
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:56,380
already know that I need to that's quite

130
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,469
a long time and I had heard that this is

131
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:03,360
a good API or this is a good product

132
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:05,979
then I would start to work um you know

133
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,759
so one of the things we're trying to

134
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:14,919
understand is what exactly is good

135
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,300
documentation so if we use the examples

136
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:18,699
is there something there that you

137
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,580
thought of okay this is something I'll

138
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:24,190
always expect from me good documentation

139
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,380
is there something missing something

140
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,659
made that made you react I think that

141
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,150
was a class or something where it there

142
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:35,169
was not an explanation

143
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:41,460
if it was sake that was one which only

144
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:46,030
had information in about see here I

145
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:49,889
think it was Baker API where they it

146
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:52,840
doesn't say what's here

147
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:55,449
or if it was to suit this super and you

148
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,880
know I read I could get more from the

149
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,770
release notes than I could from the real

150
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,660
documentation no I don't like that

151
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,740
because they it's good with a release

152
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:10,000
but it's one item in time so I want the

153
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:13,060
real documentation to actually mirror

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,070
that and I think it was when you created

155
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,510
an Indian the super end euro sound like

156
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,639
nothing there was no information about

157
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:22,110
that in the real I think it was only

158
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,610
Creighton yeah I don't think there's any

159
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:36,400
things that actually is that it came

160
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:38,979
into the super end in here but then you

161
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,110
called my intention attention apparently

162
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:44,050
because I was looking more for more

163
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,400
information yeah just example well that

164
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,510
was fun thing yeah I think it was

165
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,270
getting a when you created a new Baker

166
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:54,610
what you you're supplying the engine but

167
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,580
there's no explanation or the

168
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,500
constructor of the maker I was missing

169
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,349
that but if we talk more in general

170
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:06,340
about how we can should construct a

171
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:09,580
documentation is there anything is there

172
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,410
aught of any red flags when you see you

173
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,970
encounter a new software platform and

174
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,669
read the documentation are there any red

175
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,789
flags that you think ok this is if you

176
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,380
have a lot of proprietary parameters or

177
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,510
something which or list just listed

178
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,539
without any description on it I think

179
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:27,970
that's bad I also don't like if there is

180
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:30,250
no examples as I said before I really

181
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,890
like to have some example in the

182
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,930
beginning of a class showing or whatever

183
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,340
it is library something just showing

184
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:41,800
this is a simple example and then

185
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,360
you can use that to navigate down so a

186
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,060
simple one maybe I'm not the worst one

187
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,760
as well but have something like that in

188
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,880
the beginning is really important for me

189
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,210
how much of a should they be example be

190
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,390
more of a snippet or should it be put in

191
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,990
a context more how much of a context is

192
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,940
needed

193
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,150
I think it's depends on what type of

194
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,280
area it is if it's uh if it's a utility

195
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:10,480
library I mean that's a snippet is good

196
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:13,150
enough and if it's an item doing sorry

197
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,260
if it's let's say yeah we have those

198
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:19,660
products which are that's a reading

199
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:23,110
statistics from github for just look at

200
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:25,600
today and there they had an example this

201
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,340
is how we should do it and okay that's a

202
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,180
good example I have two factor

203
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,950
authentication what do i do nothing but

204
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:37,690
it's good enough I can understand how

205
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:40,090
big the library looks like Mason example

206
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,030
what I can do then I search further from

207
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:45,910
my special case which is outside example

208
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,410
so that was good for adapter one if if

209
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,710
there would be a full solution where I

210
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,660
had to install something to get it going

211
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:56,710
then I would assume that there was an

212
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:59,590
example somewhere because if if the

213
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:02,530
first thing is to I think that is the

214
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,960
speed to run something neuro determinant

215
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,180
so in our case in clique or would be

216
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,430
that if there wouldn't be any easy way

217
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,710
to set up the engine and quickly pull it

218
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,750
down I wouldn't bother because it's too

219
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,300
long time for me to okay now I have to

220
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,520
download something a feeling a for I

221
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,100
don't know a lot of stuff before I can

222
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,700
even get it running the small snippet I

223
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,530
have here

224
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,470
that's dangerous I think then you're

225
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:29,140
into this that prove I have to assign a

226
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,580
lot of time on it make sure that I make

227
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:38,110
it methodically and set up my ID that's

228
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:41,950
okay so the the size of the example

229
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:46,510
depends on the context of the yes so I

230
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:48,520
would say in most cases it's how fast I

231
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,650
can get something after running I will

232
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,530
have a lot better feeling about the

233
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,850
stuff if there's

234
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:57,920
has made very fast guide on just getting

235
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,690
something else then I can evaluate if I

236
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,470
would like to take this or one of the

237
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:05,780
three other items I found for this area

238
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,060
and we need to do if it's like a helper

239
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,980
library somebody'd see crucial I was

240
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:16,460
there because it if it would be an

241
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:18,110
external course or a song if I had reach

242
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,610
my show she is probably one which is

243
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,680
most popular and then there is free

244
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,220
which are popular them it needs to be

245
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,200
very quick easy way to get it running

246
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,140
for me to understand okay I should use

247
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,150
this one hmm I didn't mention him before

248
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,430
we start the interview what is your role

249
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,920
here at click I'm a development manager

250
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:41,500
for the click core team I'm not

251
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:50,030
developer for saying here wannabe hobby

252
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:55,880
and my education so what is your tasks

253
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:59,630
during the day I say so I I would say in

254
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:04,070
this this form here it's other people

255
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:07,580
manager and I'm and I think the roles or

256
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:10,339
scrum master or tried one part of a

257
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:13,570
tried which means that I'm part of the

258
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:16,430
planning the work but also about

259
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,290
suggesting solutions or priorities in

260
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,760
the team a little bit of product I ought

261
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,580
to get a bit of architect and a product

262
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,120
designer so it's a mix of those things

263
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:30,250
and development is I would say it's a

264
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,270
minimal part I use it because I like to

265
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:36,470
understand what we're doing in the team

266
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:38,060
and of interest I think in my role you

267
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,920
could get out a gift away without

268
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,550
knowing anything but you had to work in

269
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,640
a different way

270
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,810
mmm-hmm so in as part of your role you

271
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,660
don't have to read a lot of

272
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:51,410
documentation it's more when you're

273
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:53,960
working on side projects yes so it's if

274
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,300
I'm doing something in the code here

275
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,510
I'm trying to do sometimes I do it of

276
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:04,930
course but it's not my main no it's not

277
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:08,420
my part of the work hmm so but you're

278
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,530
like if click were to use a new software

279
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,630
platform you're still part of the

280
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:15,980
decision-making to use that platform or

281
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:18,260
are you taking listening to for example

282
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,660
architects and what they want to use and

283
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,900
you approve that or what's your rosin

284
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,600
yeah I'm part of it no I will rely if an

285
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:30,800
architect know that I want this because

286
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:34,010
of that I would because I would never

287
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,820
say anything against them if it's if I

288
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:40,880
don't have any person and so no that's

289
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,820
true I would probably suggest and based

290
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:54,170
on my experience suggests what I believe

291
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:57,620
is my idea of a good platform do you

292
00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:00,260
think it is working card quickly just a

293
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,320
consequence of good documentation and

294
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,570
API examples or is it a separate aspect

295
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,300
no I think it's the same actually yeah I

296
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:12,050
think it's there every library needs to

297
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,180
sell itself and proved its use and I

298
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,830
think one way is to do it like that you

299
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,140
could have a the most simple one and

300
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,680
that will be a lot harder to sell to

301
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:26,309
people if it's not easily

302
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,309
[Music]

303
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:39,029
because we if we it would be interesting

304
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,200
to get a in this interviews I'm talking

305
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,990
directly to you architects and

306
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:47,540
developers and such but now we have a

307
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:50,670
manager role here which isn't as you say

308
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:56,610
directly involved in the documentation

309
00:14:50,670 --> 00:15:02,160
reading in its work role so would you

310
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:05,520
say that you how much of an interest in

311
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,720
your work role do you take in API

312
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,360
documentation of a software platform

313
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,580
that would be used in the product for

314
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:17,760
example the platform for how we write

315
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:22,760
documentation or we could take we could

316
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:27,420
take both examples like if click were to

317
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:30,779
use another software platform in in its

318
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:35,820
product and it had to be approved and

319
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:38,700
all that how much of an interest you

320
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,540
take in your working role for that I

321
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,490
think I think it's hard to say how much

322
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,029
but I take interest in it

323
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,950
mmm because I that's a simple one like a

324
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:52,079
UI framework or something like that I

325
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,450
want to know why we're choosing a

326
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,470
special framework and I think it's it's

327
00:15:54,450 --> 00:16:01,050
twofold one is of course the one which

328
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:04,589
are important my role will this be

329
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:07,890
something which is valuable not just

330
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:10,890
today but in two years is it something

331
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,990
which works well with competence we have

332
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,690
the team and in the surroundings which

333
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,190
is something weird because it's found we

334
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,880
have to have a really good really simple

335
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:23,279
so so those are and then of course how

336
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,040
live that one is if he ever is starting

337
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,620
to maybe not in the my current role but

338
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,740
in my previous role where we bought the

339
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,300
software platforms then it was very

340
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,910
important that they are maintained

341
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,190
correctly and they are cost efficient

342
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,480
and that we get the support we need hmm

343
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,699
so all those questions are very

344
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,790
important to me now and then I would say

345
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:47,730
the rest is just my technical interest

346
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:50,580
feel it's not obliged but it's fun to

347
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:55,580
know about those though so that's the

348
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:57,690
other part but not so specific so it's

349
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:03,270
those things you mentioned is that

350
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:05,190
something that if there's some things

351
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,230
that only managers care about that

352
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:10,709
developers or architects wouldn't care

353
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:13,380
about when using a when it comes to

354
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:20,940
documentation I think that vapors tend

355
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:25,140
to play down the need for production it

356
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:29,790
could be that it's not that it's missed

357
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:31,860
out but at least in some places it's it

358
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:34,860
looks good if they it's fun to work with

359
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,470
it's good and I totally understand that

360
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,560
but sometimes it could be that you also

361
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,690
have have it a factory environment and

362
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,100
if something breaks down in that Factory

363
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,250
you will lose a lot of money each

364
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:50,420
minutes or so then you have to look into

365
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:55,350
a lot of other stuff like is there any

366
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:57,600
support contracts here which make sure

367
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,130
that this contact or there is a

368
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,220
percentage of times they're going to

369
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,930
happen because that's going to be a

370
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,790
discussion I have if I buy that sort of

371
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,070
support contract I would think

372
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,810
developers don't really want to talk

373
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,170
about those things there it's not there

374
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:15,660
a deal it's more or less purchase

375
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:18,360
purchasing discussion and like support

376
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,920
discussion and that me as a developer I

377
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,370
think you know I'm more responsible for

378
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,230
those so in my current role we don't

379
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,690
have that many of those because we're

380
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,340
using mostly open source code work in

381
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,340
open source world where there are other

382
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:36,690
things that play which is more important

383
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:39,030
like how well is this adopted by the

384
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:43,470
majority of local sort word and how much

385
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:45,300
maintenance is it and so on and I was a

386
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:48,120
historically it's not there the

387
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,960
developer the manager's primary

388
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,720
knowledge so here I depend a little

389
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,240
moron architects women taking those

390
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,179
decisions and maybe that's also why I

391
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,360
want to dig more into this because I

392
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:06,460
need to understand so I can be support

393
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,510
when when we're taking such decisions

394
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:13,970
mm-hmm

395
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:15,950
if we move over to release notes how

396
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:25,010
often would you say that you look at

397
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:27,320
release we're doing automatic upgrades

398
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,090
okay okay you have to see how it's done

399
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,620
so as I went into the other it's a

400
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,779
failed test okay I need to understand

401
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,730
why and then there was a link to the

402
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:38,289
release notes where I can see why and

403
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,289
that's all oh this is nothing

404
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,460
so that's that's thing otherwise it I

405
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:49,220
always say it's for my if I'm doing a

406
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,850
hobby product I might do it if it's I

407
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:55,610
know it's zero point version because

408
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,580
that might break break my way existing

409
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:01,100
corporation mmm but it's hobby so yeah

410
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:05,779
it's it's not that social well okay

411
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:09,429
because once again it's interesting to

412
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:13,850
see if release notes matter at all to

413
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:15,289
managers because we'll get the

414
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:20,260
perspective of architects and developers

415
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:24,919
from other interviews so do you think

416
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:26,720
general managers in general or you care

417
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,600
about release notes I would say from

418
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,350
from a manager perspective I care if it

419
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,210
breaks my stuff and if I need to add any

420
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,429
resources to this then that's my

421
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,260
perspective so nothing detailed like I

422
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:44,360
said that's not something that we look

423
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:45,830
into the furniture so if I'm going to if

424
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,789
we only talk about okay should we

425
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:51,590
upgrade to this solution I would post it

426
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:53,390
and I would participate in a meeting

427
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,010
where we took the decision then I would

428
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:58,190
be interested mmm because I want to know

429
00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:02,210
how big of a change and how much time do

430
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,230
we need to invest in such a change so

431
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:11,269
that's very important

432
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:13,210
and so for major releases that I think

433
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:17,029
that's the most important for a manager

434
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:23,120
small patches I don't think they are

435
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:28,010
only important if something has mmm so

436
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,059
in the material we had a year two

437
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,029
extremes

438
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:38,990
one very short version and were quite

439
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:42,549
elaborate version because it's when it

440
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:45,860
comes to writing release notes it's a I

441
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:48,679
mean you have to a company has to spend

442
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,679
time and therefore money in order to

443
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:55,010
have more thorough release notes and

444
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:59,419
it's a balance to between these two how

445
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:05,480
much should you write do you have any

446
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:08,690
opinion on how much I think the short

447
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:13,600
one for imaginary I think that was

448
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,600
enough that there changes in this area

449
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,330
okay there we are

450
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:23,389
it looks like they they've added some

451
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:31,309
stuff and are we using the differ kg

452
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:34,460
stuff so so from a manic perspective I

453
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:36,289
think that's that's enough for me if a

454
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,299
little bit further I think when I read

455
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:40,669
the more detailed version I think that

456
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:42,769
it was good but I suspected that to be

457
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:44,539
in the real documentation is there so

458
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:48,289
for me it would be we have added these

459
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:53,450
stuff here's a link to the documentation

460
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:56,419
where it's I don't know mmm I think okay

461
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:59,480
so maybe more like okay you can't use

462
00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:01,370
this form or use this new them all the

463
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,289
if not how you use an example states in

464
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:07,340
the region documentation mmm otherwise

465
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:10,909
you delicate so again from a manager

466
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,980
perspective when you decided to use a

467
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:15,230
new platform then it has to be approved

468
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,539
its release that's something that will

469
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,659
be looked at

470
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:25,450
before as part of the are we gonna use

471
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:27,459
this yeah I think that matiee the patch

472
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,429
ones I think being your changes like

473
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:32,529
that sometimes have other presentations

474
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:34,690
not in the release notes section it's

475
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:37,629
more like this new feature to have all

476
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,979
these many features and I'm sure would

477
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:43,029
probably look at that and see if it

478
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:44,859
matches their need and then probably

479
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:48,599
also architects and developers to tell

480
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:51,369
how much work they needed to put in to

481
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:53,889
fulfill the rest of the stuff the

482
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:58,469
deprecated stuff was known so I don't

483
00:23:53,889 --> 00:24:01,119
think the manager it's even even before

484
00:23:58,469 --> 00:24:05,019
like even before something has been

485
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:06,549
adopted you probably all probably check

486
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:10,239
ok that it's like the pricing you'll

487
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:11,559
infect II like lore surrounding it and

488
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:14,440
maybe it'll check out how is the

489
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:16,450
permutation how is it support but you

490
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,009
probably not check ok are the release

491
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,469
notes gonna be good when we're gonna

492
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:23,109
need them in one year probably not

493
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:33,519
I think that's unfortunately not to say

494
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:35,379
it's I probably should and then I have

495
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,969
to back a little bit on one thing since

496
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:38,649
I also have a scrum master role as a

497
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:40,450
manager which is not normal but in this

498
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:42,519
company we have it I would be interested

499
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,190
in what has actually changed when I came

500
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,529
into that solution so first I would take

501
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,479
the decision on a modular but if I get

502
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:51,579
into scrum master and then are more into

503
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:53,379
an operative mode and then I need to

504
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:55,359
know okay what what type has chance do

505
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:57,789
what deprecated Partizan then I would

506
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,309
probably read it together office it's a

507
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:03,089
little bit of a mixed role that's why

508
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:03,089
maybe it's mixed

509
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:17,929
mmm we can move over to a white

510
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,929
community night

511
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:26,160
so in general when I just say that a

512
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:28,940
software has an online community what

513
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,410
does that mean to you active discussions

514
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:35,720
that people are asking question and

515
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:45,360
they're getting answers quickly and

516
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:49,830
preferably not an active there are

517
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:55,020
people out there helping so in

518
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:58,530
communities that you like what did they

519
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,870
have in common that they are polite

520
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:07,440
first and they're there they are

521
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:11,970
elaborate answers to questions if

522
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,460
someone comes with a problem also on

523
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,410
there are people answering to the right

524
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,650
level because sometimes it could be

525
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:21,660
people who misuse this but I have to

526
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:26,580
show something to my manager please do

527
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:29,370
this for me I don't think those but you

528
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:37,530
should at least support out here some

529
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:43,260
help but to get you stormed here you

530
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:46,230
have this thing yeah so is it important

531
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:57,809
that the community feels alive that's a

532
00:26:46,230 --> 00:27:00,510
very and also as you said they take

533
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:05,070
immunity must be helpful then it helpful

534
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:08,130
and but also polite yeah Politis that

535
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:10,590
I've seen some communities they are an

536
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,290
exception but they could be like yeah as

537
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:16,049
I said read the fucking that people are

538
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:20,669
trying and I think that's scaring people

539
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:23,550
away yeah supposed to be very complex

540
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:24,370
and cool but it's not helping if you're

541
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,559
inviting we

542
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,660
like that with that turn you away from

543
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,730
if you'll just stop me I was using a

544
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,309
software platform I need to Google

545
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:39,580
something and you realize okay this is

546
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:42,490
the kind of yeah it's a decision which

547
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,200
goes a lot of indicators even if it's

548
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,850
like that then you have bad communicator

549
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:57,490
documentation that needs to know that

550
00:27:45,850 --> 00:28:00,790
really and because as community it could

551
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:05,650
be either be like for a click we have to

552
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:07,300
branch or comma community that's managed

553
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,340
by clique themselves and then you have

554
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:13,900
like a communities that only exist on

555
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:16,300
Stack Overflow for example for they is

556
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:23,380
Stack Overflow one where it has its own

557
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:25,210
life is it important that the the

558
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:28,210
company behind the software that they

559
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:31,059
are a part of that community not

560
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:34,450
necessarily if taking if it's so famous

561
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:36,700
that people are there and answering all

562
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:39,910
the questions and they are correct to

563
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:42,730
sponsors then I think the company has

564
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:45,250
succeeded in something really cool so

565
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:49,590
for me it would just tell me that yeah

566
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,590
this is a really good product people are

567
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,710
helping each other just because they

568
00:28:53,950 --> 00:29:02,290
like it that's good this has also a

569
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:05,350
thing that's that's a time I first and

570
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:06,820
therefore money by the company that they

571
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:12,550
spend a lot of time I'm answering

572
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:16,090
community questions how important is it

573
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:18,490
that the company answers questions I

574
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:21,820
think it goes down to money question

575
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:24,130
area if it's if you can get I get by

576
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,570
without because there's a lot of people

577
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:28,330
are saying these things for you then

578
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,899
you're lucky you're a lucky company and

579
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:32,960
you don't need to do that

580
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:35,299
if it's not it's a niche product or if

581
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,009
it's you're struggling to get people to

582
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:39,349
work with and so on I think you have to

583
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:42,289
help people are get going if you're

584
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:45,820
going to create the community I think a

585
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:52,009
lot about what you you probably need to

586
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:54,649
have a seed the community strategy and

587
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:57,529
then you can back away if you think that

588
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:58,849
the communities is working by itself in

589
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:08,089
the beginning you probably need to be

590
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:09,649
there hmm so like just overall to put it

591
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:12,859
concise what what do you want from an

592
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:15,139
online community I think it's I want

593
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:19,219
answers to my questions I think that's

594
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:21,919
it so if I'm if further but if I'm

595
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:25,039
looking for different from evaluating

596
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,349
different products what I want for my

597
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,509
community is an active community I want

598
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:32,539
to see that's live there's good answers

599
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:35,779
to questions and it feels like then then

600
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:38,719
it's a plus in my decision mmm if I have

601
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:40,909
already decided or there's only one then

602
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:44,690
of course I have to make do with what I

603
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:52,279
have but then I have the same needs but

604
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:55,909
maybe I can have less more less because

605
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:58,969
I have to I have to use it so so let's

606
00:30:55,909 --> 00:31:02,179
say that there was such a thing as a

607
00:30:58,969 --> 00:31:06,109
flawless documentation would you still

608
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:12,979
need an online community not if I didn't

609
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:20,599
have any documentation gives all I need

610
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:23,599
mmm okay so yes that's also a any

611
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:25,369
company could invest energy in making

612
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:30,229
the community more alive or making API

613
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:34,599
documentation better so making the

614
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:36,979
documentation better it could replace a

615
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:39,900
community the need for a community you

616
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:43,410
say yeah

617
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,300
but the I think that is it's a little

618
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:48,300
bit dependent that area because it could

619
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:51,000
be really hard to provide examples which

620
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,950
are good enough for most people who

621
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,510
comes an interest area mm-hmm

622
00:31:52,950 --> 00:32:02,900
while a community or more maybe if

623
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:06,090
they're willing they can put the

624
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:08,820
solution in perspective to the question

625
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,290
which a documentation couldn't do so if

626
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,910
you have an area which are very generic

627
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,470
for example you can do whatever with it

628
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,410
and then people come in are able to do

629
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:19,500
this fun stuff then I guess a community

630
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:21,360
could catch that person easier than our

631
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,880
documentation we should be very generic

632
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,510
in them okay don't really know if I can

633
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,250
do this or not

634
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,990
mmm the communique yeah of course you

635
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,540
can you just use these four or five

636
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:33,750
different calls and then something like

637
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:39,210
this and here's a very easy to see it so

638
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:42,090
in in reality they're do there is a need

639
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:45,179
of for an online community yeah if it's

640
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,740
a very generic product because you said

641
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:48,630
the perfect or perfect augmentation

642
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,940
would have a solution for requesting

643
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,500
you're kidding okay so so if but if you

644
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:58,500
step down to a more realistic approach

645
00:32:52,500 --> 00:33:02,220
yes I think that our it exists there

646
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:09,780
exists companies and solutions which

647
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:12,090
would require community have any

648
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:15,870
questions for me or something you

649
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:17,580
thought I would ask that I didn't know I

650
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:28,860
think it was good at the Oscar what my

651
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:32,070
role was I think it's very important to

652
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,630
to steer it yeah but now getting that

653
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:40,440
perspective I think when I started

654
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:42,960
thinking here different actually so I

655
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,730
started answering for two different

656
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,320
perspective we just might be a little

657
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:51,120
bit confusing so maybe I should just

658
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,000
describe my previous row

659
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,910
I was a product owner and a little bit

660
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,010
of response over purchasing in my

661
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:02,940
current we're working purely know the

662
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:06,270
source more my role is more technical so

663
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:10,260
I have a large interest in solutions but

664
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:11,760
not purchasing decision since most

665
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,250
things are for free you know the source

666
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,080
and it's the technology which rules so

667
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:24,240
they are different somehow

668
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:26,880
these different roles mmm open-source

669
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,620
bird is actually complicating it a

670
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,840
little bit you don't have this

671
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:33,120
historically ok the manager stands for

672
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:39,480
the money and and the developers for

673
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:46,670
their so that might be something you can

674
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,670
pick up here yeah yes what I made it

675
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:59,360
clear your role as India we had a good

676
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:59,360
perspective from the nominal okay thanks
