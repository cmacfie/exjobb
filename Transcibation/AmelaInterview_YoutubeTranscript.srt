1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:06,000
okay so today's the 6th of September

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,940
yeah

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,250
December sorry and we're at clique

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:16,230
offices and this is Christopher McPhee

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,270
talking and I'm here with my honored and

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:24,000
you work here at the clique yeah I work

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:27,949
a clique as a software engineer hmm so I

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,949
have some questions for you regarding

9
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,300
we're going to talk about API rate

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,070
lighter stuff we're gonna talk a little

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,690
bit about release notes and we kind of

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,860
talked a little bit about online

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,590
communities around software platforms

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:48,660
hmm and you looked at some material

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:55,829
beforehand so if we start with API

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:01:01,079
related things okay so when you're

17
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:04,500
looking at how important would you say

18
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,770
that API examples a documentation is for

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,040
a software platform probably one of the

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,680
most important things when it comes to

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,900
documentation because I would say most

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,659
for most people that's the first thing

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,610
you look at because if it's an API

24
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,330
you're not familiar with the examples

25
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:29,880
are the the way you actually want to get

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:31,590
familiar with how things are working so

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:37,320
when you look at a very examples why are

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:39,990
you trying to what are you looking for

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,850
like when you look up by examples what

30
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,850
is it what is it you want to find out I

31
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,380
don't know I guess it depends on what

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,810
I'm looking for sometimes it can be if

33
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,450
I'm looking at a specific method I want

34
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,939
to be able to find that quickly and to

35
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:02,450
have an example of how that thing works

36
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:06,490
in specific way and I guess it should be

37
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,200
clear examples consistent examples and

38
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:12,530
[Music]

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,150
yeah I don't know

40
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,299
but and and also that there's some

41
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:21,739
explanation not just code but also

42
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:24,659
explanation about what that code does

43
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:28,319
yeah some kind of documentation about

44
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,150
the methods and what they do and how

45
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,599
they should behave hmm

46
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,079
so it's it so would it's more of a it's

47
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,849
a mixture of trying to understand how

48
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:43,019
they are used and where they were used

49
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:45,359
or yeah yeah of course and copy paste

50
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:49,530
encoded that it's not something that is

51
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:52,709
good for code examples as well or just

52
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:55,260
to what do you mean for you mean for the

53
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:59,519
developer to be able to just copy paste

54
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:03,120
and try something out I think it's good

55
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,849
if you can get like if you can try

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:11,389
something out quickly just to see that

57
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:14,400
that's what you're that it works I guess

58
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:17,579
but it doesn't need to be a complete

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,859
example in which you know everything is

60
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:23,730
done for you hmm

61
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:26,010
it's more important of a concise example

62
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,530
we just what they're trying to explain

63
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:31,739
rather than a big one yeah I think it's

64
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,599
good to have it really depends on the

65
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,109
case sometimes it's nice to have both

66
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:41,099
like to use that example in the context

67
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:42,720
of something bigger but it it really

68
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,150
depends on the method if it's it

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,220
something something as simple as you

70
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,609
know you need to do a copy paste then

71
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,190
it's enough to just focus on that simple

72
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,840
method how to do a copy paste with this

73
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,849
API okay

74
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,540
because it doesn't really have a lot of

75
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:05,190
dependencies on other things so I think

76
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:07,919
it really depends when it comes to it's

77
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,609
not really API is but in click when it

78
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:14,329
comes to the scripting language when you

79
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:18,060
developed apps and things for example

80
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:22,139
there it's nice to have examples that

81
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:25,480
are within a bigger context so yeah it

82
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,400
kind of depends but I would

83
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,770
if I have to choose then it would be it

84
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,830
would be more concise examples that just

85
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,080
show you okay this is what I wanted to

86
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:40,540
know and I don't have to go searching

87
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,400
like they said in the context of click

88
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,060
it's new you have it a bigger example

89
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,340
when is it not when it's in what context

90
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:55,000
is better to have a smaller example then

91
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:58,120
it's like what makes click and they get

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,490
bigger yeah yeah so in this sense it

93
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,180
wasn't click as everything related to

94
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,460
click it was specifically because yeah I

95
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,560
always complain and other people I think

96
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,920
always complain with the documentation

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,370
regarding the app development and

98
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,650
scripting and in that case you need more

99
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,310
knowledge before you can jump into a

100
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:23,200
specific method so there you kind of

101
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:29,230
it's important to have more step-by-step

102
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:31,120
things it's more advanced we need yeah

103
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,210
yeah because you can't just you need

104
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,490
some prerequisite knowledge in order to

105
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:40,120
get to that okay so I think in every

106
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:44,770
documentation it's important if you know

107
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,480
that you need some some prerequisite

108
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,670
knowledge that it's not maybe very

109
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,210
common that it's nice to have those

110
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:55,210
examples as well or at least some links

111
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:58,540
or references to where can you learn

112
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,640
about that because it's yeah it can be

113
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,530
quite annoying when you get start

114
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,990
reading an explanation and then there's

115
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:10,540
ten ten things you don't even know what

116
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:13,690
they mean and it's nowhere explained so

117
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,870
how does it affect you if you're looking

118
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:20,860
at FBI examples and they're not very

119
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:23,320
good how does that affect your work well

120
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:29,590
if I have a choice to find something

121
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:31,780
else to use then I would just do that if

122
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,590
I don't have a choice well usually you

123
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,870
have a choice I mean usually you can

124
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,690
choose between different different

125
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,110
options

126
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:47,540
which API used to go go to do this the

127
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,220
same thing so in that case if you select

128
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,110
one thing and then you see the

129
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,970
documentation is bad usually you just

130
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,170
scrape it and turn to something

131
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:59,930
different had the situation like that

132
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:03,530
recently when we started and that we

133
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:07,640
actually implemented stuff using this

134
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:10,580
I forgot how it's called doesn't really

135
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,790
matter but we had the written code and

136
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,790
everything and yeah it was all the

137
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,440
working examples but more and more we

138
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,170
were working with it we realized the

139
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,090
documentation is really lacking and it

140
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,850
was difficult once you get into problems

141
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,830
to fix them so we actually just scraped

142
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:31,720
that and started all over again with the

143
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:36,260
difference so with a different solution

144
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:43,390
so yeah it's it definitely affects the

145
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:47,180
developer in a bad way so looking at the

146
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:50,210
material is there anything that you saw

147
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,210
that okay this is very important or this

148
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,640
is not important or is there some key

149
00:07:53,210 --> 00:08:00,530
aspects that you're missing here that

150
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:03,380
you usually look at it was a lot of

151
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:06,140
pictures yeah but yeah it's definitely

152
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:10,310
good that there is some there were some

153
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:16,790
examples of how to do well in this case

154
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:19,130
yeah very basic example like the this is

155
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:23,090
how you get started that's nice and then

156
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:27,200
some example of okay this is one step

157
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:29,390
more a bit more advanced so I think

158
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:33,260
that's a nice way to present it to have

159
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:35,560
like the very basic one and then to go

160
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,710
into this is how you can modify things

161
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:44,450
so I definitely like that and yeah I

162
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:46,700
like that you have in meta descriptions

163
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:51,050
that you have listed like the parameters

164
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:53,800
and their types and description that's

165
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,800
always helpful

166
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,030
so is that something that is something

167
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,570
that should always exist or is it some

168
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:04,820
kind of like a bonus this is good if it

169
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:09,020
exists I would say it's something that

170
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:13,100
should always exist so I mean it seems

171
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,930
like a very basic basic description to

172
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,730
have like when you want to use method

173
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,990
you want to know which parameters since

174
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:23,660
has what type they can be and yeah what

175
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:28,700
do they actually do so for me that's

176
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:31,000
kind of a must examples as well like

177
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,000
always

178
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:40,420
yeah release notes that's always good to

179
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:44,630
have just to make sure you're not using

180
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:47,290
something that doesn't work anymore or

181
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:54,830
will be deprecated then once you upgrade

182
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:58,730
hmm later so another thing about you've

183
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:00,980
touched upon this a bit to have working

184
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:05,270
code quickly is that something that is

185
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:08,480
important to you I think it's nice to

186
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:11,690
have working code quickly to have some

187
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,360
kind of a basic example quickly but then

188
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,850
once of course it would usually need

189
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,080
more work and more time when you want to

190
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,690
have something more advanced

191
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,450
but it's nice to be able to say okay

192
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,150
this is how I can at least get the setup

193
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:29,570
part done and I can see that I get

194
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:32,540
something out so you don't have to spend

195
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:35,720
the day and then oh this this doesn't

196
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:39,080
work at all yeah so I think having some

197
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:43,280
kind of a basic working example it's

198
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:45,500
important so in what situation are you

199
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,780
willing to accept not something working

200
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,780
code quickly is it always needed to have

201
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:54,380
just the getting basics okay this is

202
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:57,050
rendering and then don't what bounced oh

203
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:02,440
can you wait for a long time I guess if

204
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:05,090
I know that it's something that

205
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,470
definitely works that it doesn't matter

206
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,720
I do I

207
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:13,460
need to be the one testing it so it's

208
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,320
something that's how do you say it's

209
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,450
kind of a standard you know people are

210
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,840
using this and it works I'm not gonna

211
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:24,340
run into some trouble where oh this is

212
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,470
very experimental that someone wrote and

213
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,480
yeah I need to be the one testing it so

214
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:34,190
I guess in that case it doesn't really

215
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,260
have to be a quick working example hmm

216
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:40,670
because I'm already aware okay maybe

217
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:45,710
there is even a community around the

218
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:49,190
solution so yeah maybe that's that's one

219
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:51,440
reason but you you said that early that

220
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:56,420
he scraped and started over because of

221
00:11:51,440 --> 00:12:01,840
the documentation being poor so that was

222
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,840
more you work is with something new then

223
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:11,540
did you have started what working code a

224
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,150
issue there or just that is so that this

225
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:18,500
wasn't scalable if this documentation is

226
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:21,470
poor yeah it's so exactly it was it was

227
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,330
you could get a quick working example

228
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,280
and that's quick in that case quickly

229
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,550
and you could do the basic things

230
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,740
quickly and it worked well but after a

231
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:34,190
while every time you ran into a problem

232
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,990
and you wanted to fix it and you look

233
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,480
into the documentation it's like it

234
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,850
doesn't say anything here okay and if

235
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,860
you try to google it it's you know maybe

236
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,410
you'll find something maybe you don't so

237
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:50,000
you're kind of left on your own which is

238
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:53,030
not a very nice thing or something like

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,220
that does like the answer does exist in

240
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:58,490
the documentation but you need to search

241
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,740
for it for half an hour because it's not

242
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,920
ordered in a correct way or it's very

243
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:10,520
inconsistent or I don't know

244
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:12,530
so after kind of how do you say after

245
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,710
having the same problem multiple times

246
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:18,259
then we realized okay if this continues

247
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:21,350
happening you just keep losing time

248
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:22,970
time you want to fix something so we

249
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,519
kind of scraped it and did the

250
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,189
investigation okay what are our other

251
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,489
options and in this case let's try to

252
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:33,589
look at the documentation straight away

253
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:35,989
and see if all of the problems we had

254
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:44,059
with the older one are now gonna be

255
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:47,989
mixed so what do you say that working

256
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:50,959
code quickly is if the documentation is

257
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:53,679
good and they are examples are good will

258
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:59,269
you always have working code quickly

259
00:13:53,679 --> 00:14:01,369
those links yeah I there definitely

260
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:04,129
linked yeah the better the documentation

261
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:07,609
is the easier it will be for you to get

262
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:09,679
get up and running I mean but obviously

263
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:11,629
as I said then the other way around uh

264
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,429
support working code quickly it doesn't

265
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:19,600
mean that the documentation will be good

266
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:23,559
yeah yeah in that case it doesn't so

267
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,959
yeah it kind of the good documentation

268
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:29,419
brings a lot of good things with it and

269
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:34,489
the bad documentation will bring a lot

270
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:38,269
of bad things but yeah I guess even in

271
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:42,470
bad documentation it's it's possible to

272
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:45,379
have basic examples but then once you

273
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,549
get into the more advanced stuff then it

274
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:49,669
fails you hmm

275
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:55,399
so the documentation it's a very key

276
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:58,939
part of it effects everything yeah okay

277
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:04,579
so if we move over more to talk about

278
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:07,839
release notes in general how often would

279
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:12,730
you say that you look at release notes

280
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:16,970
not very often really but it's usually

281
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:20,389
not me who and who has to decide between

282
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:24,499
like which software we are using or

283
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:27,589
which solutions which api's so I guess

284
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:30,189
it's not so often that I did I look at

285
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:30,189
it because of that

286
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,590
but yeah but I think it's still it's

287
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:40,400
still important to be able to find

288
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:44,230
release notes because eventually you

289
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:47,840
will want to like you want to upgrade

290
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:49,820
whatever software you're using and in

291
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,310
that case if you don't have

292
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,590
documentation you can easily run into

293
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:58,970
trouble if you don't have release notes

294
00:15:54,590 --> 00:16:00,730
like this and so when you end up looking

295
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,440
at released under what circumstances

296
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,890
since you're not as you said the decider

297
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:14,570
to upgrade when you look at them why how

298
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:19,940
come you do that it's really for when it

299
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:21,590
comes to api's even not when if we take

300
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:27,430
the context that you're working on

301
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:30,980
something privately for example yeah I

302
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:35,390
guess yeah if you if you work on

303
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:37,370
something privately and then in that

304
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,230
case it will make more sense to look at

305
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,580
release notes but at the same time if

306
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,730
you're look if you're working on

307
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,710
something privately that's like just it

308
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,560
doesn't need to go into production or

309
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:52,280
something then you don't care too much

310
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:57,950
about if you're using a deprecated

311
00:16:52,280 --> 00:17:01,580
method or not so yeah but I think when

312
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:05,540
it comes to I mean I can talk about in

313
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:08,770
the context of since our team is working

314
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:16,640
with API governance and the entire work

315
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:19,720
kind of the entire how you say job let's

316
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,180
say job where the goal is to present the

317
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,640
API changes and to make sure that the

318
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,640
customers that are using click API is

319
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,760
know what has what has changed between

320
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,590
releases because for them when they want

321
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:41,960
to upgrade to a new version of clixsense

322
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:44,450
that's very important so from from that

323
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,800
perspective looking at how how much

324
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:50,060
other people are injured

325
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:55,340
in having us presents that then it seems

326
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:59,260
like it's quite important yeah so what

327
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:03,620
is important to have in release notes I

328
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:06,800
guess it's important to have enough

329
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,960
details so that people are know people

330
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:14,540
know what what has happened between

331
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:17,210
releases for us we usually just and I

332
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:21,890
think most they just present kind of

333
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:24,650
what has what has changed if you have

334
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:29,350
new methods or new ways of doing things

335
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:33,470
and if you are supposed to avoid some

336
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,850
methods that you were using before so in

337
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:40,040
the material we have a very detailed

338
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:44,540
release note and very non detailed do

339
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:53,750
you see any observe downs with either

340
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:56,450
version yes yeah so here in the short

341
00:18:53,750 --> 00:19:00,290
release notes when you have like the new

342
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:04,210
updated you don't really know what has

343
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:09,650
changed if one of these has been updated

344
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:11,300
so it doesn't say from it doesn't say

345
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:14,030
which one of these are completely new

346
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:17,720
which are updated and how they are

347
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:19,940
updated so that's something I that would

348
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,550
be my first question like I don't know

349
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,680
what has happened I just know something

350
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:29,450
has changed but it's what exactly I have

351
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:32,270
and then in the deprecated one you see

352
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:35,090
that four methods have been deprecated

353
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,370
but then if you have the if you have

354
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,410
used these methods in your code it

355
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,960
doesn't say what you should do instead

356
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:44,900
hmm so you're kind of left wondering

357
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:51,680
okay how am I supposed to fix my code

358
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:55,400
and I think this was fixed in the big

359
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:58,050
change lock yeah you have a list of the

360
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:04,480
Prakriti methods and you

361
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:07,060
specify what you should use instead yeah

362
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,540
even having the reasoning why you remove

363
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:15,940
something I think I think that's nice

364
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:21,990
when you defecate it kind of builds how

365
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:29,650
you say it builds trust when you can

366
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:34,750
explain why we did this change as if we

367
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:39,010
took the bigger version is it too

368
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:43,420
detailed is to like it or is it like how

369
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:48,880
it should be in quotations you have an

370
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:51,160
issue I think when it comes to release

371
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,650
notes if you would choose between having

372
00:20:51,160 --> 00:21:00,100
not enough and too much it's better to

373
00:20:53,650 --> 00:21:04,690
have too much I mean if it's like a few

374
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:08,470
pages or like a screen you usually know

375
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:13,380
what you want to look for so it's easy

376
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:20,710
to find even if it's a big big text

377
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:24,400
button here yeah I think it's nice it

378
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:30,430
seems like I wouldn't have it I wouldn't

379
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:44,710
need this yeah having bugs and talking

380
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:48,850
about when it was introduced so if there

381
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:56,020
are if the release notes are poorly

382
00:21:48,850 --> 00:22:02,260
written how would they affect you I

383
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:05,260
think it's bad when it comes to kind of

384
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:08,880
the trust I mentioned between whoever is

385
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,960
using the API and whoever is developing

386
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,679
if it's a big company

387
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:20,049
such as click I know it's always really

388
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:22,240
big it's a big deal in a bad way if if

389
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:23,950
you upgrade to a new version of cents

390
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,200
and all of a sudden things are not

391
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,620
working I think it reflects really

392
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,700
poorly on the company and yeah it's

393
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,700
definitely a big deal

394
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,450
are there any other way of obtaining

395
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:44,950
this kind of information then release

396
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:49,600
notes or is that the only is that the

397
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:52,299
go-to way of finding out this finding

398
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:57,340
out kind of the changes between releases

399
00:22:52,299 --> 00:23:04,240
yeah some companies take more care of

400
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:06,669
release notes and some don't but if you

401
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:12,039
don't have good release notes these

402
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:13,090
companies still exist - they still do

403
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:16,480
they have it some other way of

404
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:20,770
presenting this or is it just that they

405
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,470
have poor release notes yeah I'm not

406
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,480
sure what the other way would be I guess

407
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,740
depends on how you call it but yeah

408
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,600
there should be some way of finding out

409
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:39,730
what has happened in between releases I

410
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:41,480
would say so if we move over to and talk

411
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:45,470
about online communities and study

412
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,470
[Music]

413
00:23:51,250 --> 00:24:00,890
so how do you take help from online

414
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:04,820
communities when working all the time

415
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:06,530
all the time yeah so so how important is

416
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,090
it for you when you work with software

417
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,300
there there is an online community

418
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:14,860
around it I think it's quite important

419
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:17,750
because sometimes even when you have a

420
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:21,500
documentation that's average or even

421
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:23,510
good it's always nice to have online

422
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,640
communities because you have then people

423
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:29,810
that's run into the same issues as you

424
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:32,180
do and I think it's enough to be in a

425
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:35,870
community it can be either on github

426
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:38,600
like you have opened issues on the

427
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:44,120
repository something as small as that or

428
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:46,100
just enough users that use the software

429
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,130
so you get for example and Stack

430
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,320
Overflow you can see issues of people

431
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:55,280
using the same thing it doesn't have to

432
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:59,780
be like a specific site that's dedicated

433
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:02,050
just to that product I think online when

434
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:05,660
it comes to online community it's like

435
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:07,760
anywhere on the internet but yeah I

436
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,890
think it's definitely important so even

437
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,980
even if the documentation was flawless

438
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:15,560
you still want a on my community around

439
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,420
it yeah I think it's still nice to have

440
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,240
an online community because then you see

441
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:22,400
that people are actually using using it

442
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,650
like the documentation can be perfect

443
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:30,170
but if no one is using this then why

444
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:34,010
should I so is it important to feel like

445
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:36,460
you're a part of a community yeah I

446
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:40,880
would say so

447
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:44,240
so why is it important then what happens

448
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,560
if you're working with a software that

449
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,740
doesn't have an online community how

450
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:52,610
does that make you feel I don't know it

451
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:56,570
seems like as I said like why am I the

452
00:25:52,610 --> 00:26:01,880
only one using this that will be kind of

453
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:03,120
my question if I try to if I find I know

454
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,710
some software something

455
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:10,650
Pearson product and I can't find anyone

456
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:13,970
else using that thing I would it would

457
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:18,750
be like okay there's something wrong

458
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:21,210
there's something that fit so I think in

459
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,190
in that sense it's important to feel

460
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:28,050
like okay there are other people using

461
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:30,180
it other people that maybe have run into

462
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:33,300
the same issues and have solved the same

463
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:37,500
issues and you have someone also to turn

464
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:40,200
to kind of when you run into problems so

465
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,760
are they an a can you think of if you

466
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,860
tried to think of communities in

467
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,890
encounter that you liked and counted

468
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,809
communities that you didn't like what

469
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:58,860
are the differences between these two

470
00:26:48,809 --> 00:27:03,750
communities examples of communities that

471
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:07,890
I didn't like you know think of the

472
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:10,020
things that are when you come into a

473
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,840
community that you feel like are like

474
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:15,030
this community some aspects that that

475
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:19,170
community had that you were like okay

476
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:24,590
this is this is positive yeah I'm mature

477
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:29,400
in the sense of like working with api's

478
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:31,980
because for me when I say in that sense

479
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:36,390
it's not like a specific place you go to

480
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:39,390
and you are talking only about it's it's

481
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:41,429
just having people that are using it and

482
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:46,080
it can be as I said on github or in

483
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:48,210
Stack Overflow or yeah wherever it's

484
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,300
important that it feels alive the

485
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:54,420
community yeah yeah that's for sure and

486
00:27:51,300 --> 00:28:02,070
is it is it important that it feels

487
00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:04,260
helpful yeah yeah I mean if if you see

488
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:06,240
that there are people or there is some

489
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,510
type of online community but there's

490
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,360
either very little people or people that

491
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:16,830
are not not active in it then it's

492
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,190
really not useful in the end and yeah

493
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,860
you

494
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:21,860
to be able to engage with other people

495
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:29,070
it's important that the software the

496
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,620
company connected to the software that

497
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:34,980
you're using that they're part of the

498
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:39,210
community yeah I think that's always

499
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:41,490
good I think it I don't think it's

500
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:45,510
necessary that they are part of the

501
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:51,960
community but I think it it would make

502
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:55,980
the the consumer feel better about using

503
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,930
the product and feel yeah again coming

504
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:04,560
back to the trust and the relationship

505
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:07,020
between the the product and the user so

506
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:12,540
it's it can't be a bad thing I would say

507
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:15,120
okay so is there a difference if you're

508
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,490
using is something big like a software

509
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,380
platform compared to something small

510
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:25,430
like a library what do you expect from

511
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,870
the online community

512
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:31,920
yeah I think it's definite there's

513
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:34,320
definitely a difference I mean for for

514
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:39,630
something small like a library you

515
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:42,150
usually yeah you don't need the same

516
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,680
level of interaction basically and

517
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:48,930
usually it's something that you will

518
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:50,640
just use a few times and don't think

519
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:53,460
about it but when it comes to the

520
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:58,020
platform it's probably something you

521
00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:01,680
interact with constantly hmm so you kind

522
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,720
of want to have yeah then it's more

523
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,820
important to have a bigger community and

524
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,900
online community community or even a

525
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:13,320
separate space just for just for the

526
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:15,330
platform itself I'm more important with

527
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,190
only but the bigger it is the more

528
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,440
important yeah yeah I would

529
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,530
I mean when it comes to a small library

530
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,650
basically if you find something on

531
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:27,810
github to me what I look at is that it's

532
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,230
updated it doesn't really need to have

533
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:31,320
an own

534
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:34,860
and community around it as long as you

535
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:37,700
see that it's still ongoing and that

536
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:43,260
it's not that when it comes to updates

537
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:48,780
so yeah it's the size matters yeah so it

538
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:56,280
like overall what is it that you want

539
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:59,160
from an online community I guess I can

540
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:04,530
think about it in terms of click sense

541
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:09,059
and that type of community but yeah I

542
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:13,290
think I would like to have yeah activity

543
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:19,100
and people interacting with each other

544
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:22,100
and having questions and examples and

545
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,100
yeah

546
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:31,020
is there anything we've you want to ask

547
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,900
me or something you thought about that

548
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:37,260
you thought I'd ask that yeah I haven't

549
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:49,950
or something that you I don't know

550
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:53,580
nothing that I can think of then I think

551
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:57,740
that I've got all the answers I need

552
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,740
okay great thank you very much
